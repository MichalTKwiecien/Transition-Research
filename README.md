# iOS View Controller Transition and animations research

It's very simple project showing how we can use custom transitions and animations to switch between view controllers.
There are versions for modal presentation but also for usage with UINavigationController.

In the demo app at the top we can use UISwitch to present view controller or push it using navigation controller.
